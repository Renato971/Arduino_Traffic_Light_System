# Arduino Intelligent Traffic Light System

This project created an intelligent traffic light system using Arduino. The actual code was done on Tinkercad as its a software that will allow you to virtually connect the components and also programm it. The traffic light has three modes; Regular, Pedestrial and Night mode. Please node that extra features such as an LCD screen was also added to make the design more complex.

Regular mode- When the distance is above 10cm, the red LED will turn on for 1 second, then the yellow LED for 2 seconds, followed by the green LED for 2 second and finally the yellow for 1 second. **This will repeat until something changes.**

Pedestrian mode- When the distance is less than 10cm, the yellow LED should turn on and flash for about 10 seconds and simultenously a buzzer should start making noise. **This will repeat until something changes.**

Night mode- When the distance is above 60cm, the red LED should stay on until the distance goes below 60cm and then the green LED should turn on and stay on until the distance goes above the set amount (60cm). **This will repeat until something changes.**

This work was done by **Renato Dushku** only as a part of a university assigment.
